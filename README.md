## 🚩 Problem Statement

In India, most insured patients discover what their health insurance actually covers **after hospitalization**, when hospital bills are generated and medical decisions cannot be reversed.

Key challenges include:
- 📄 Complex and lengthy policy documents  
- ❌ Misconception that cashless treatment means full coverage  
- ⚠️ Hidden limits such as room rent caps, consumables, and sub-limits  
- ⏱️ Lack of guidance at the decision-making stage  

Existing platforms focus on buying insurance or tracking claims, leaving a critical gap **before treatment begins**.
